# Document Outline

Displays a hierarchical, interactive outline tree view for document markup.

Also registers as an outline provider for Atom-IDE for the supported document types.

## Support types

Currently supports:

- Markdown (Commonmark)
- Latex
- ReStructuredText
- AsciiDoc
- Knitr

## Usage

Trigger using `document-outline:toggle` or enable `show by default` setting. Single click to jump to heading in document, double click to collapse sub-headings.

Alternatively, enable the outline view of Atom-IDE (and disable the `show by default` setting).

Note: for simplicity, only 'modern' UI themes are supported (i.e. not the atom-light or atom-dark themes). Should work for popular UI themes including One-light/dark and Atom-material.


## Why?

It's easy to get lost working on long documents - an outline view is a huge help. With document-outline, jump to headings in your document, and see the currently edited section highlighted in the outline.

Some handy packages for working on long form markdown documents:

- [preview-inline](https://atom.io/packages/preview-inline) (shameless plug) allows quick inline previews of LaTeX math equations and images in documents without having to generate a preview
- [language-pfm](https://atom.io/packages/language-pfm) syntax highlighting for the pandoc variety of markdown
- [markdown preview plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus) enhanced HTML preview of markdown documents
- [build](https://atom.io/packages/build) plus `build-makefile`. If you use Pandoc to build serious documents, your pandoc command starts to get pretty fancy. Do yourself a favour and write a makefile for that, then use atom-build to easily trigger building your document from the editor.
